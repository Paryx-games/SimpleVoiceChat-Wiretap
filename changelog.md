**Changelog (1.3.0)**

- 1.21.8 Support
- Somewhat reverted using item components and brought back NBT/CustomData.
  - Because of this, the mod is once again server-side only. No need to require it in client mod packs!

Due to the item changes, *all* wiretap items from previous versions will be broken. Blocks should continue to work fine.
